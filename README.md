# YARM = YAML + ARM

This is my first "real" Go program.  I can't stop you from laughing at my code, but I sure would appreciate constructive feedback instead.

## Getting started

```shell
go install github.com/lastcoolnameleft/yarm
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lastcoolnameleft/yarm
yarm content/resources/vnet.yarm content/values/vnet.yaml
```
